The MICCA data dictionary [is available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S29xBrtnBHl-4IqUFSSOOOza7ekrqY0i/view?usp=sharing).


**Purpose:** To define the data items collected for MICCA, including all variables and their allowed values.


**Key requirements:** There are a few key requirements that should be followed in general when preparing the spreadsheet:

- **One row per patient:** The spreadsheet contains patients who delivered, and each patient appears only once.
- **No blank values:** Where data is missing or unavailable, the value “unknown” should be entered, rather than entering nothing. The specific meaning of “unknown” is defined for each column.
- **Population cohort or sample:** The data are intended to a) include all patients who delivered in a cohort, or b) represent a sample of the population of patients who delivered within each quarterly cohort. When a sample of patients is used, these should be randomly selected from each month of the quarter if possible.
