The MICCA data dictionary <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S29xBrtnBHl-4IqUFSSOOOza7ekrqY0i/view?usp=sharing>is available here (PDF)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Purpose:</b> To define the data items collected for MICCA, including all variables and their allowed values.
  </p>


  <p>
  <b>Key requirements:</b> There are a few key requirements that should be followed in general when preparing the spreadsheet:
  </p>

  <ul>
	<li><b>One row per patient:</b> The spreadsheet contains patients who delivered, and each patient appears only once.</li>
	<li><b>No blank values:</b> Where data is missing or unavailable, the value “unknown” should be entered, rather than entering nothing. The specific meaning of “unknown” is defined for each column.</li>
	<li><b>Population cohort or sample:</b> The data are intended to a) include all patients who delivered in a cohort, or b) represent a sample of the population of patients who delivered within each quarterly cohort. When a sample of patients is used, these should be randomly selected from each month of the quarter if possible.</li>

  </ul>
