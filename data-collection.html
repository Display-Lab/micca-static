  <p> A blank template spreadsheet for collection of MICCA data is available as an <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjvZgGzlcTAw0L2wgu3By0zOCq5It_rB/view>Excel spreadsheet</a> or a <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vk4WWSx5U2AF28FE2eMHKuCNW2Ea1I5-2bEGN7P5qCI/edit#gid=0>Google Sheet</a>
  </p>

  <p>
  Definitions of the collected variables their allowed values are specified in the <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S29xBrtnBHl-4IqUFSSOOOza7ekrqY0i/view?usp=sharing>MICCA Data Dictionary (PDF)</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
 There are a few key requirements that should be followed in general when preparing the spreadsheet:
  </p>

  <ul>
        <li><b>One row per patient:</b> The spreadsheet contains patients who delivered, and each patient appears only once.</li>
        <li><b>No blank values:</b> Where data is missing or unavailable, the value “unknown” should be entered, rather than entering nothing. The specific meaning of “unknown” is defined for each column.</li>
        <li><b>Population cohort or sample:</b> The data are intended to a) include all patients who delivered in a cohort, or b) represent a sample of the population of patients who delivered within each quarterly cohort. When a sample of patients is used, these should be randomly selected from each month of the quarter if possible.</li>

  </ul>
